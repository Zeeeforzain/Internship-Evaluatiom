# Description<br>
The website is a simple yet effective demonstration of my ability to design and structure a web page, with a focus on aesthetics and usability.
Comprised of three main pages, the website serves as a mini-portfolio that highlights key web development techniques and principles. 
The homepage is designed to welcome visitors with a clean and visually appealing layout. Using HTML, I structured the page with a clear header that includes navigation bar, a main content section and a footer.
The header features the navigation bar provides links to the other two pages: an "About Me" page and a "Contact us" page.
The main content section of the homepage includes a brief introduction to the website. CSS is used extensively to style the homepage,ensuring that it is both attractive and easy to navigate. For instance, I used various CSS properties to control the layout,typography, and color scheme, creating a cohesive and professiona look. 
The "About Me" page offers a more detailed introduction to my background and skills. 
Here, HTML is used to structure the content into sections. I employed CSS to enhance the visual appeal of this page,using techniques such as flexbox  to create a responsive layout that looks great on both desktop and mobile devices.
It is yet a very small website that is made according to requiremenets of JJ's IT. I have not added any extra component and I tried to keep this as simple as possible with proper nevigations to all pages.<br>
